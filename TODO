A rough timeline of the tasks to finish before we see release, large and small.

# Environment and Data Structures

* An LRU cache for objects to live in while resident in memory.
* error handling and reporting system.
* include a logging system.
- make the SConstruct files a little more cross-platform.
* obl_database struct (a place for the cache, logger, and error handlers to
   live).
= the rest of the obl_object internal format structs.
* manual creation functions for obl_shape objects.
- consistent handling of obl_object type errors.
- disentangle header includes.  use extern definitions whereever possible.
- de-anonymize structs and enums.  it makes references nicer, but the C community
   frowns upon it, and it makes some things messier.
= conversion functions from C data types to obl_object types.
- obl_at_address should hit fixed space and the cache.
- relocate fixed space to high addresses instead of low ones.  it'll help future-
   proof obl databases.
* take out all direct references to int32_t and uint32_t types; replace them with
   obl_word and obl_uword types in platform.h.

# Primitive I/O

- implement mmap() and munmap() equivalents for MinGW.
- read/write integer objects.
- read/write the rest of the single-word object formats.
- read/write slotted objects.
- read/write fixed objects and Unicode strings.
- read/write chunks and manipulate chunked objects.
- read/write tree pages.
- read/write arbitrary objects by reading the shape word and delegating to one
   of the other object-reading functions.
- implement the address map with tree pages.
- implement the address allocator.
- bootstrap new obl_databases by writing the root object.

# Advanced I/O

- write the transaction mechanism.

# Compound object interfaces

- implement the index object, probably as a generalization of the B+ tree
   address map.
- design high-level set and dictionary interfaces that use indices to organize
   references to other objects.
- write the shape index.

A rough timeline of the tasks to finish before we see release, large and small.

# Environment and Data Structures

* An LRU cache for objects to live in while resident in memory.
* error handling and reporting system.
* include a logging system.
- make the SConstruct files a little more cross-platform.
* obl_database struct (a place for the cache, logger, and error handlers to
   live).
- the rest of the obl_object internal format structs.
- manual creation functions for obl_shape objects.
- conversion functions from C data types to obl_object types.

# Primitive I/O

* read integer objects.
- read/write the rest of the single-word object formats.
- read/write slotted objects.
- read/write fixed objects and Unicode strings.
- read/write chunks and manipulate chunked objects.
- read/write tree pages.
- read/write arbitrary objects by reading the shape word and delegating to one
   of the other object-reading functions.
- implement the address map with tree pages.
- implement the address allocator.
- bootstrap new obl_databases by writing the root object.

# Advanced I/O

- write the transaction mechanism.

# Compound object interfaces

- implement the index object, probably as a generalization of the B+ tree
   address map.
- design high-level set and dictionary interfaces that use indices to organize
   references to other objects.
- write the shape index.
